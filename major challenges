‚úÖ Example 1: Handling High Concurrent Requests
"One of the major challenges I faced was handling high traffic during peak hours in the delivery tracking system. We noticed that the API response time for live tracking was increasing and sometimes timing out.

To solve this, I analyzed the logs, added performance profiling, and found that some queries were not optimized. I created indexes on key fields like orderId and agentId, implemented caching using Redis, and optimized the Sequelize queries.

As a result, the response time improved by nearly 60%, and the system became stable under load."


‚úÖ Example 2: Managing Race Conditions During Inventory Updates
"In one project, a big challenge was preventing race conditions when multiple users tried to order the same inventory item. The quantity sometimes went negative due to parallel updates.

I solved this by wrapping the critical part of the code in a database transaction using Sequelize, and added row-level locking to prevent concurrent modifications.

This ensured data consistency, and we no longer saw negative inventory after that fix."

‚úÖ Example 3: Collaborating with a Non-Responsive API
"We had to integrate with a third-party logistics API, which was often slow and had inconsistent responses. This caused our order confirmation to delay or fail.

I implemented retry logic, fallback responses, and proper timeout handling. I also created a queue system using Bull.js to manage retries in the background.

This made our system more robust and improved user experience."
