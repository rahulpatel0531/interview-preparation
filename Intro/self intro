“Hi, my name is Rahul Patel. I'm from Indore and currently based in Jaipur. I have 2 years of experience as a software developer, primarily working with Node.js and related technologies. During this time, I’ve contributed to several projects — one of them being Learn Tree, an online platform that provides virtual classes to students.

In this project, I was responsible for designing RESTful APIs, integrating third-party services, and implementing features such as file uploads using Multer, email sending with Nodemailer, and authentication with JWT.

I'm always focused on improving my development skills and learning best practices to write clean, scalable backend code. I’m excited about the opportunity at XEBO.ai to work on impactful products and grow in a collaborative environment.”
