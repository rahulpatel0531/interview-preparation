"In my last project, I worked as a Node.js backend developer on a delivery platform where users could place orders, and delivery agents could manage their trips. My main responsibilities included creating REST APIs with Express.js and Sequelize using a PostgreSQL database. I implemented user authentication using JWT, wrote database models with relationships (such as customers, orders, and delivery agents), and added features like search, pagination, and filters. I also collaborated with frontend developers, tested APIs using Postman, and managed code through Git."
