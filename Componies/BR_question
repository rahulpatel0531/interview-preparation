    a trigger is a set of SQL statements that are automatically executed (or "triggered") in response to a specific event or action that occurs within a database. Triggers are used to enforce data integrity, perform logging, or automate certain actions when changes are made to data in database tables. Triggers are typically associated with tables and can be set to execute either before or after specific data manipulation operations (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) occur.

    CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name
    {BEFORE | AFTER} {INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE} ON table_name
    FOR EACH ROW
    BEGIN
        -- SQL statements to be executed when the trigger is triggered
    END;
